# whatt
A library that makes it easier to make Whatsapp self-bots.

### Getting started.
First off, take the library out of the `build/whatt.min.js` file and paste it into your console. When that's done, you can start building your Whatsapp self-bot! Start by looking in the /examples directory for some examples on how to use the library.

Have fun with it!

### Notes
- When you refresh the page, the bot is gone and you need to import the library + your code again.
- Use it at your own risk, self-bots aren't allowed by Whatsapp.
